Shout Outs

This package was created with Cookiecutter_ and the `audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`_ project template

.. _Cookiecutter: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter
.. _`audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage`: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage

Inspired by the original Java client written by `Hermann Pencole <https://github.com/hermannpencole>`_

The client SDKs are generated from OpenAPI definitions using
`swagger-codegen v3 <https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen>`_,
with repo-maintained mustache templates. Generated code is then reviewed
and refined in this project.

Props to the NiFi-dev and NiFi-user mailing list members over at Apache for all the assistance and kindnesses.
